# oop  object-oriented programming

## def
/->is a fundamental programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes(blueprint) and objects  (instance), it is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprint (classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. 


/->  a class is an abstract blueprint that creates more specific, concrete objects. class often represent broad categories, like car or dog that share attributes like color , but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.

/->a class can also contain functions called methods that are available only to objects of that type. there are defined within the class and perform some action to that specific object type
example : 
class blueprint used to create two car type objects, mycar and merci_o 



class templates are used as blueprint to create individual objects. Example : class car can create object like mycar or merci_0  that have unique values to the properties (color,brand,model) defined in the class 
we can then reuse this class to represent any number of cars, without affecting other objects or the class template
2/Benefits of oop for software engineering 
oop models complex things as reproducible, simple structures
reusable, oop object can be used across programs 
polymorphism allows for class-specific behavoir 
easier to debug, classes  often contain all applicable information to then
securely protects sensitive information through encapsulation

# OOP  object-oriented programming

## what is OOP
/->is a fundamental programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes(blueprint) and objects  (instance), it is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprint (classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. 
## Building blocks of OOP
- Classes
- Objects :  instances of a class
- Methods
- Attributes
## class = attributes + methods

 a class is an abstract blueprint that creates more specific, concrete objects. class often represent broad categories, like car or dog that share "attributes" like color , but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.

 class can also contain functions called methods that are available only to objects of that type. there are defined within the class and perform some action to that specific object type
example : 
class blueprint used to create two car type objects, mycar and merci_o 
 ## object = new name_of_that_class

class templates are used as blueprint to create individual objects. Example : class car can create object like mycar or merci_0  that have unique values to the properties (color,brand,model) defined in the class 
we can then reuse this class to represent any number of cars, without affecting other objects or the class template
## Benefits of oop for software engineering 

- oop models complex things as reproducible, simple structures 
- reusable, oop object can be used across programs 
- polymorphism allows for class-specific behavoir 
- easier to debug, classes  often contain all applicable information to then
- securely protects sensitive information through encapsulation 
## Four Principles of OOP
- Inheritance: child classes inherit data and behaviors from the parent class
- Encapsulation: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
- Abstraction: only exposing high-level public methods for accessing an object
- Polymorphism: many methods can do the same task
### Inheritance
Inheritance allows classes to inherit features of other classes. Put another way, parent classes (superclasses or base classes) extend attributes and behaviors(methods) to child classes (subclass, derived,extended). 
#### The benefits
Inheritance supports reusability.

### Encapsulation

#### The benefits

### Abstraction
To abstract something away means to hide away the implementation details inside something – sometimes a prototype, sometimes a function. So when you call the function you don't have to understand exactly what it is doing.

#### The benefits

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows the same method to execute different behaviors in two ways: method overriding and method overloading.
#### Method Overriding



#### Method Overloading
Compile Time polymorphism uses method overloading. Methods or functions may have the same name but a different number of parameters passed into the method call. Different results may occur depending on the number of parameters passed in.
#### The benefits
- Objects of different types can be passed through the same interface
- Method overriding
- Method overloading
## Conclusion
Object-oriented programming requires thinking about the structure of the program and planning out an object-oriented design before you start coding. OOP in computer programming focuses on how to break up the requirements into simple, reusable classes that can be used to blueprint instances of objects. Overall, implementing OOP allows for better data structures and reusability, saving time in the long run.
